# Difference Triad Engine

**English abstract (public‑facing).**  
This file summarizes the original note located at `docs/zh/difference_triad_engine.md` for international readers.  
It aligns with the repo’s core mapping — **Deleuze → Differential Geometry → Category‑theoretic Pullback** — and presents only the essentials needed to understand how the concept plugs into **LSC‑PB** (the metric) and the minimal demo.

**Why it matters.**  
It provides a structural handle to prevent rhetorical alignment and forces auditable context alignment across domains.

**How it plugs in.**  
- Role in pipeline: concept → structural rule → measurable condition.  
- Hook points: metric interface in `metrics/`, demo in `scripts/run_demo.py`.  
- Failure mode: when no intermediate context *L* yields a bounded residual, the example becomes a minimal counterexample.
