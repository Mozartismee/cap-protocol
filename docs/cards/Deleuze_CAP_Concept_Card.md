# Concept Card · Deleuze × CAP (Integrated)

## Boundary Paragraph

Terms like “rhythm,” “refrain,” and “line of flight” are often conflated. Further wording tweaks at the language level no longer yield effective distinctions, and public adjudication requires operational criteria. This card consolidates the original Deleuze↔CAP mapping and adds three precise pieces: (i) the relation and order between refrain and rhythmization, (ii) triggers for lines of flight, (iii) a minimal bridging language (Pre/Post/Err/Win) for auditability.

## 1) Deleuzian Terms (operational definitions)

* **Plane (plane of consistency)**: a working ground where connections are possible and comparable.
* **Milieu**: a local field of rhythms and exchange rules.
* **Abstract machine / diagram**: the rule-field that permits or forbids connections on a chosen plane.
* **Assemblage**: an operational network of heterogeneous elements on the same plane.
* **Coding**: a set of coupling rules (permissions/forbiddances) that make operations repeatable and auditable.
* **Territory**: a workable zone cut out by a recognizable, adopted return-pattern that separates inside from outside.
* **Refrain**: a recognizable pattern that returns and is adopted by its surroundings, summoning elements and settling a territory.
* **Rhythmization**: the ongoing adjustment of borders by multiple milieus on a plane through refrains, maintaining a sustainable operating window.
* **Deterritorialization / reterritorialization**: loosening territorial borders from within and rebuilding them under new conditions.
* **Line of flight**: a directed transformative trajectory that crosses existing coding, preserves a minimal trace, and lands in new connections or a new plane.
* **Plateau**: a sustained window of intensity that neither collapses nor spikes, suitable for operation and handoff.
* **Overcoding**: a centralizing code that freezes variety into rigidity.

## 2) CAP Terms (operational definitions)

* **Philosophy layer**: sets aims and standards.
* **Language layer**: fixes public differences and commitments.
* **Mathematics layer**: secures commitments by structures and proofs.
* **Technology layer**: witnesses under measurable conditions and controls risk.
* **Language boundary**: the point where wording adjustments cease to add effective distinctions.
* **Landing**: extracting a minimal, auditable standard from an upper layer and implementing it in the next layer.
* **Lifting**: moving to a more abstract plane to restore generativity.
* **Nesting**: forming a composite plane where two layers co-adjudicate.
* **Public adjudication interface (coding)**: repeatable rules and responsibility points.
* **Plateau**: a stable window used as the prelude to landing or transfer.

---

## 3) Bidirectional Interpretation (concise)

* **Plane ↔ Context plane** (choose one among philosophy, language, mathematics, technology).
* **Milieu ↔ Frameworks and data sources within a layer**.
* **Assemblage ↔ Operational network within a layer**.
* **Coding ↔ Public adjudication interface and test rules**.
* **Refrain ↔ A followed return-pattern that settles a working window**.
* **Rhythmization ↔ Multi-milieu “keeping time” on the plane that sustains the window**.
* **Line of flight ↔ Trigger for lifting or nesting**.
* **Plateau ↔ Stable operating window before or after transfer**.

**Operational sentence**: choose a plane → use a diagram to connect an assemblage → minimally code near the language boundary → if rigid, first deterritorialize; if still insufficient, nest or lift → once a new plateau forms, land.

---

## 4) Refrain and Rhythmization: relation and order

* **Relation**: rhythm is material; a **refrain** is rhythm that is recognized and followed, acquiring territorial efficacy.
* **Order**: typically **rhythm precedes refrain**, refrain feeds back to **generate or reorganize rhythm**. The process is cyclic, not linear.
* **Multi-milieu action on a plane**: at least two milieus meeting on the same plane make it easier for a refrain to “stick” and form a territory.
* **Three-beat chain**: noise → recognized rhythm → refrain/territory → coordination and variation → new rhythms or a line of flight.

---

## 5) Minimal Bridging Language (Pre/Post/Err/Win)

Use this to make public adjudication possible.

* **Pre**: declare the chosen plane, the participating milieus, and the target under test.
* **Post**: require an observable outcome (a sustained window or repeatable connections).
* **Err**: list failure modes (pure periodicity without territorial effect, or overcoding that kills variation).
* **Win (time window)**: fix an observation window and a retest budget to ensure auditability.

---

## 6) The Three Key Terms: operational criteria

### Refrain

* **Success**: a return-pattern is recognized and followed, summons behavior, and separates inside from outside into a workable window.
* **Misread**: mere repetition without adoption or coordination.
* **Cost focus**: signal clarity and alignment by others.

### Rhythmization

* **Success**: multiple milieus keep time on the same plane, sustaining a window that can carry landing or handoff.
* **Misread**: rigid structure masquerading as a window; zero lines of flight.
* **Cost focus**: cross-milieu composability and stability.

### Line of flight

* **Success**: crossing existing coding while preserving a trace, then establishing new connections or a new window elsewhere.
* **Misread**: mere breakdown (no trace) or reskinning (no new connections).
* **Cost focus**: traceability and verification of the new window.

## 7) Example (plain-language window: the “apology” test)

**P (rigid claim)**: “Saying ‘I’m sorry’ suffices for an apology.”

**Procedure**

1. Prepare five short “apology” snippets:
   a) sincere face-to-face “I’m sorry”;
   b) mumbling “I’m sorry” while scrolling;
   c) a message that only says “I’m sorry”;
   d) “You were wrong too” followed by “I’m sorry”;
   e) a boss forcing an employee to read “I’m sorry” publicly.
2. Adjudicate **by wording only** (no context), with three judges. Record agreement.
3. You will likely get a list of **disagreements** (especially c, d, e). This is the visible fracture at the language boundary.
4. **Follow the fracture (produce a line of flight)**: introduce a simple language-action frame with three checks:

   * Utterance present (said “I’m sorry”),
   * Intention to take responsibility,
   * Uptake or follow-through (the addressee can accept or respond).
     Re-adjudicate the five snippets. You get sharper distinctions: (a) usually passes; (c) and (e) often fail; (d) depends on intention and uptake.

**Reading**

* **Refrain**: an adopted classroom clap-pattern that summons coordination and separates inside from outside.
* **Rhythmization**: repeated “sample → adjudication → revision” produces a stable window for decision-making.
* **Line of flight**: the move from “wording only” to a minimal language-action frame is a crossing that preserves a trace and lands in new, workable connections.

---

## 8) Short Inferences (with failure conditions and costs)

1. If a return-pattern cannot summon coordination, a refrain does not exist. Cost lies in signal cleanup and alignment mechanisms.
2. If a window is stable but yields no new connections, the system is rigid. Remedy: deterritorialize internally or introduce nesting to restore variation.
3. If the crossing loses traceability or fails to land in new connections, it is not a line of flight. Remedy: add a minimal bridge (shared interface or vocabulary) or reset the window.

---

## TN (hidden transition, two sentences)

The pressure comes from conflating “followed recurrence” with “mere repetition,” which breaks adjudication and transfer. Adjust the rhythm by first deterritorializing within the same plane with a minimal bridge, then choose nesting for co-adjudication or lift to a more abstract plane.

---

## Alignment Check Card (four questions)

* **Role recovery**: are plane, milieus, assemblage, refrain, territory, coding individually identifiable.
* **Relation recovery**: how rhythm becomes a refrain, how a refrain produces a territory and window, how a line of flight crosses to new connections.
* **Chain coherence**: can cross-milieu exchanges compose and be replayed within the time window.
* **In-place conservation**: do core markers and commitments remain trackable across de/reterritorialization and cross-layer moves.
